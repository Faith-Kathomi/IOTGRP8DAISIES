## 📘 Project Overview

This project is focused on designing and developing a smart greenhouse system using IoT and embedded technologies to determine and maintain *ideal conditions for growing a daisy flower*. By collecting real-time environmental data and processing it intelligently, the system aims to automate the monitoring and control of key variables such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and light intensity.

## 🎯 Objective

To identify and maintain optimal conditions for daisy growth through an embedded IoT solution, using sensors, actuators, microcontrollers, and cloud technologies.

## ✅ Deliverables

1. *Sensor Integration:*  
   - DHT22 or equivalent for *temperature and humidity*  
   - Soil moisture sensor  
   - LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) or light sensor  

2. *Embedded System Design:*  
   - Microcontroller setup (ESP32/Arduino/Raspberry Pi)  
   - Real-time data acquisition from sensors  
   - Actuator control logic (e.g., relay-based fan/water pump/LEDs)

3. *Data Analysis & Logging:*  
   - Continuous logging of environmental conditions  
   - Identification of ideal growing conditions based on readings  
   - Use of thresholds to determine when action is required

4. *Cloud Integration (Azure):*  
   - Data publishing via MQTT/HTTP  
   - Real-time dashboarding using Azure services (IoT Hub, Azure Stream Analytics, Power BI)

5. *Automation & Alerts:*  
   - Triggering watering/fan systems based on live conditions  
   - Optional: Notification system for anomalies

6. *Documentation & Reporting:*  
   - Detailed report on system design, data trends, and results  
   - Codebase and circuit diagrams  
   - Summary of findings on ideal daisy conditions
